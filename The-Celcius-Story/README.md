Recently, the crypto lending platform Celsius leaked massive amounts of user data in their bankruptcy filings. Some people took the data and created questionable products that were spread on social media. These were used to find out about personal losses by some but were also used to bully and publicly shame others. I wanted to look at this data and share it in an ethical way. 

What can we learn about this collapse and what it means for the industry going forward? Oddly, it wasn't the average investor getting screwed this time. The results might surprise you: 

This ethical aproach included breaking down customers anonymously into "Customer Types". This abstraction accounts for the sum of deposits made to Celsius. There are 5 groups, starting in the 0-$1k range and ending in Millionaires. The 1k-10k sector constitutes the largest proportion of the customer base with over 18k. this is followed by 10k-100k, then 0-1k, and finished with the highest brackets in order. The medians in this range shift towards the lower bonds suggesting that the populations are distributed mostly at the lower bonds with a small number of induviduals consittuting hte rest.

Typically cases like these invlovle the lowest value customers facing disproportinately bad outcome comparet tot heir higher value counterpart. Strangly, it wasn't the typical retail investor worse off in this tragedy. I'll explain. Let's start by break down 'who' was depositing funds onto Celsius and 'how' much. Although a vast majority of its users deposited less than $100K of value, a majority of assets on the platform were provided by high value customers. You can see this clearly that the abundance of low deposit users came no where close to matching high deposit users on the platform.

With a basic understanding of the customer base we can moe into the evnets that have transpired. The timeline of the Celsius collapse can be broken down into a few distinct events:
-April 12, 2022: Non-accredited investors were prevented from using the Earn product and prevented from depsoiting new crypto assets onto the platform. 
-May 11, 2022: Rumors began to circulate on Twitter surrounding Celcius' solvency and involvement with the collapsed Terra Luna. Disregarded by the official Celsius account and CEO.
-June 12, 2022: Celsius freezes all Withdrawals, Swaps, and Transfers due to 'market conditions.

When we track the number of withdrawals, we can clearly see these events playout. Initially (4/12), the customer base remained calm. After the rumours of insolvency (5/12), there was a mass exit. This was primairyly led with low value customers due to their obvous advantage in numbers. Finally **before** they closed withdrawals (6/12), there was a mass exit. this exit was slightly lower in range to the previous. All customer base groups failed to reach the intensity of before.

From a purely transactional perspective, it seemed that all groups were exercising caution. The initial assumptions were that evacuations would be more likely from high value customers. This proved not the case. The exodus could be broken down into event windows. Both periods tell a similar story. Interestingly, low deposit customers are overrepresented here when compared to overall deposit amounts. 

When Celcius paused withdrawals, there were a massive amount of funds still trapped on the platform. At first, glace the amount seems to be distributed exactly how we've seen previously. When we look at the percentage of funds withdrawn vs deposited we see the real story.

The enlightening monent comes when you are able to compare the percentage of withdrawn funds withing each group. This is (Funds remaing on Celsius) / (Funds Deposited on Celsius). The first three groups of lower value custoemrs all had deposits of over 83%. 2 highest value customers saw rates of 80.6% and 74.6%. High deposit customers were the worst at escaping! They got hit the hardest by the Celsius withdrawal pause! This was completely contrary to the expected results.

One would assume that high deposit individuals would be the most cautious. How could this happen? On side interesting point is in the celsius liquidation numbers. One could assum borrowers were adversely effected by liquidations due to Celsius pausing withdrawals. As crypto has cropped in price over the last year many loans are likely closer to being margined called. Now Celsius makes it more difficult for users to add more colateral during this time. Another question is, Why would borrowers use a centralized platform for borrowing against ETH when many DeFi options exist at better rates? this fact could shed light on the type of customers being trapped.

This leads me to search for a plausible explanation. 

What kind of customers are attracted to Celsius? What does a higher proportion of high depositors mean overall? What does it mean that ETH was unproportionate liquidated on Celsius with DeFi existing?

I'm going to extrapolate out some assumptions and possibly overreach but here it goes. I assume a massive amount of these higher net worth individuals were older investors, interested in crypto but apprehensive about self custody and navigating on-chain. The Tragedy of Celsius is that serious investors, looking to participate in crypto in a safe way, got rekt. I'm sure investing in crypto made them a laughing stock of their circles to begin with and they got burned. Think they are coming back? Think they'll tell their friends?

We could bully them yes.  "Not your keys not your coins". This is true. In this case, is this productive? 

Let's not blame the victims who took a risk on our magical internet coins and got burnt massively. Maybe let's blame the crypto grifter larping as bankers as they run around shitcoining just like we are. 

Not only that but when questioned about their involvement in high risk assets, they lied,  lied again, and mislead their customer base about their financial status. This analysis reinforces the current crypto debate. What should regulation in this industry involve and should it exist at all? It will not discuss that here but hopefully, this thread can add some context about the urgency of the issue.

Hey, thanks for making it to the end. Follow for more ice cold takes and analysis.
